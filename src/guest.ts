 * a user types `@Bot query`, picks our card, and Telegram posts it with `via @Bot` attribution.
 * That attribution line is the oldest distribution primitive on the platform, so the same
 * `GuestReply` a bot builds for a guest summon is answered here verbatim.
 *
 * Differences from the guest path, all handled here so a bot's `reply()` never changes:
 *  - the query is `ctx.inlineQuery.query`, already bare (no @mention to strip) — `queryText`
 *    reads whichever of the two updates is present.
 *  - the destination chat is unknown, so only private-style buttons are safe: "Open @bot".
 *    An "Add to this group" button in a chat that is not a group would be a dead link.
 *  - result ids must differ per answer or Telegram may cache/collapse them, so the id is a
 *    short hash of query+timestamp instead of the guest path's constant "g".
